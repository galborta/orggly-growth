# @useOrggly Twitter Playbook - Brand Account

**Last updated:** January 13, 2026  
**Next review:** After first campaign completes

---

## Update Log

- **Jan 13, 2026:** Initial version
- *[Future updates will be logged here]*

---

## Account Purpose

@useOrggly is the official Orggly brand account. It's where we:
- Announce new campaigns and features
- Share platform metrics and milestones
- Highlight successful community outcomes
- Maintain professional brand presence

**What this account is NOT:**
- A high-frequency posting account (max 1x daily)
- A personal account (that's @galborta)
- An engagement account (we amplify, not initiate conversations)

---

## Posting Frequency

**Target:** Max 1 post per day (often less)

**Why so infrequent?** Authority over volume. Every @useOrggly post should matter.

**When to post:**
- Campaign launches
- Weekly campaign results
- Major platform features
- User success stories
- Partnership announcements

**When NOT to post:**
- No real news to share
- Would just be repeating @galborta
- Trying to "stay active" (silence is better)

---

## Content Types

### Campaign Announcements
**Format:** Professional, data-focused, clear CTA

> • $23,100 $NUB total budget
> • Quote tweet campaigns (TOS-safe)

### Feature Updates
**Format:** What changed, why it matters

Example:
> New: Impression bonuses now live
>

## Voice & Tone

### What We Sound Like
- **Professional:** Clean, polished, data-driven
- **Product-focused:** Features and outcomes, not hype
- **Minimal emoji:** Use sparingly (🚀 for launches, • for lists)
- **Direct:** No fluff, get to the point

### What We DON'T Sound Like
- **Casual:** "gm frens!" (that's @galborta's domain)
- **Salesy:** "Revolutionary!" "Game-changing!"
- **Overly technical:** Save detailed explanations for @galborta
- **Apologetic:** Don't say "sorry for the wait" - just ship

---

## Relationship with @galborta

**@useOrggly's role:** Amplify  
**@galborta's role:** Engage

**How they work together:**
1. @galborta posts about campaigns with context and personality
2. @useOrggly posts official announcement with clean data
3. @galborta engages with community, answers questions
4. @useOrggly stays professional, minimal replies

**Never:**
- Post the same thing from both accounts
- Have @useOrggly reply to casual banter
- Use @useOrggly for damage control (that's @galborta)

---

## Crisis Response

**Rule:** @useOrggly doesn't handle crises.

**If something breaks:**
1. @galborta posts the update, explanation, fix
2. @useOrggly stays silent until resolved
3. Once fixed, @useOrggly posts brief "issue resolved" update

**If community is upset:**
1. @galborta engages directly
2. @useOrggly doesn't acknowledge unless it's affecting platform operations

---

## Timing

**Best times to post:**
- Campaign launches: 10am Barcelona time
- Weekly metrics: Monday 9am Barcelona time
- Feature updates: Tuesday/Wednesday 10am Barcelona time

**Avoid:**
- Weekends (lower engagement for professional content)
- Multiple posts in same day (dilutes authority)

---

## Examples (Good vs Bad)
