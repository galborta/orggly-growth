## Overview

This playbook covers how to engage with the Nubcat community across their primary channels: Twitter (@nubcat, community members) and Telegram (@nubportal).

**Core principle:** Be a community member first, Orggly founder second.

---

## Nubcat Telegram (@nubportal)

### Activity Level
- **Check:** 3x daily (morning, afternoon, evening)
- **Post:** Max 1x every 2 days
- **Reply:** When directly mentioned or when you have genuine value to add

### When to Mention Orggly
**YES:**
- Someone asks about $NUB utility
- Discussion about coordination tools
- Someone asks what you're building
- Relevant to current conversation

**NO:**
- General appreciation threads
- Art posts ("Love this Nubcat!")
- "Free Nubcat" solidarity posts
- Random introduction of your product

### Example Interactions

**GOOD:**
> User: "We need more ways to use $NUB beyond just holding"
> 
> You: "That's actually why I built Orggly - communities can pay holders in their own tokens for real work. Happy to share more if interested, don't want to spam the chat."

**BAD:**
> User: "Just bought more $NUB!"
> 
> You: "Nice! You should check out Orggly where you can earn $NUB for creating content!"

### Red Flags You're Overdoing It
- Getting "who are you?" questions
- People asking you to stop promoting
- You're the only one talking about Orggly
- You're posting more than established community members

### Success Signals
- Community recognizes your name
- People DM you first
- Included in community discussions naturally
- Asked for opinions on Nubcat matters

## Nubcat Twitter

### Quote Tweet Strategy

**Target:** 5-10 quote tweets per day of Nubcat content

**What to quote tweet:**
- Community member art/memes
- Nubcat lore discussions
- $NUB holder excitement
- Leon Karssen updates
- Nubcat community wins

**Your commentary should:**
- Add genuine perspective
- Show you understand the culture
- NOT mention Orggly unless directly relevant
- Feel like a community member, not marketer

### Example Quote Tweets

**GOOD:**
> [QT of Nubcat art]
> 
> 12 years of consistent character development. Leon kept creating through platform bans, algorithm changes, zero financial incentive.
> 
> That's not hype. That's culture.

**GOOD:**
> [QT of $NUB price discussion]
> 
> The interesting thing about $NUB: The character had 250k+ Instagram followers before the token existed.
> 
> Most memecoins create tokens hoping culture follows. Nubcat had culture first.

**BAD:**
> [QT of any Nubcat content]
> 
> Love this! This is why Orggly is perfect for the Nubcat community! Check out our campaigns at...

### Reply Strategy

**Engage with:**
- Posts from active Nubcat holders
- Discussions about utility/roadmap
- Questions about community coordination
- Celebrations of Nubcat wins

**Avoid:**
- Replying just to get visibility
- Forcing Orggly into every conversation
- Correcting people unless they're factually wrong about something important

## Monthly Review Questions

1. **Recognition:** Do community members recognize @galborta handle?
2. **Trust:** Are people DM'ing you first (vs you always initiating)?
3. **Value:** Are your contributions valued beyond just Orggly?
4. **Balance:** Are you mentioned as "community member" not just "Orggly guy"?
5. **Natural:** Do Orggly mentions feel organic or forced?

If any answer is "no," dial back promotion and increase genuine engagement.
