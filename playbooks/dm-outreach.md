# DM Outreach Playbook

**Last updated:** January 13, 2026  
**Next review:** After first 20 DM conversations

## Update Log

- **Jan 13, 2026:** Initial version - Listening tour approach
- *[Future updates will be logged here]*

---

## Overview

This playbook covers when and how to DM Nubcat community members. The current approach prioritizes **feedback gathering over participation requests**.

**Key principle:** Earn the right to invite participation by building relationships first.

---

## Who to DM

### HIGH PRIORITY (DM These First)
- âœ… Active Nubcat community members (regular posters in Telegram/Twitter)
- âœ… $NUB holders with 1K+ followers who create content
- âœ… People who've posted about wanting more $NUB utility
- âœ… Community members who've engaged with your tweets
- âœ… Nubcat artists/meme creators

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (DM After Building Some Presence)
- âš ï¸ $NUB holders with <1K followers (still valuable feedback)
- âš ï¸ People who follow @nubcat but aren't super active
- âš ï¸ Community members you've seen but never engaged with

### DO NOT DM
- ❌ Accounts >50K followers you've never interacted with
- ❌ People who don't know Nubcat
- ❌ Anyone you've never seen engage with Nubcat content
- ❌ The same person multiple times if they didn't respond

---

## When to DM

### GOOD TIMING
- **After they post about Nubcat** (within 24 hours)
- **After you engage with their content** (reply/quote tweet first, then DM)
- **After they engage with your content** (they replied/liked your tweet)
- **When they explicitly ask about utility** (perfect opening)

### BAD TIMING
- ❌ Cold outreach with no prior interaction
- ❌ Immediately after they follow you (feels automated)
- ❌ During community drama/crisis
- ❌ Late night (respect timezones)

---

## DM Templates

### Template 1: Feedback Request (USE THIS FIRST)
**Purpose:** Build relationship, get insights, NOT asking for participation

```
Hey [name], saw [specific thing they did/posted].

I built Orggly for communities like Nubcat - basically a way for communities to coordinate and pay members in their own tokens.

Would love 10 min of your feedback on what we built. Not pitching participation, genuinely want to know if this makes sense to $NUB holders.

[link to platform or specific campaign]

No pressure if you're busy!

- Gal
```

**Why this works:**
- References something specific (shows you're not copy-pasting)
- Makes it about feedback, not asking them to do work
- Low pressure ("no pressure if busy")
- Clear what you're building
- Respects their time (10 min)

### Template 2: After Receiving Feedback
**Purpose:** Thank them and optionally mention campaign

```
Really appreciate the feedback on [specific thing they mentioned].

[How you're incorporating their feedback or what you learned]

Campaign is live if you want to participate, but no pressure - the feedback already helped.

[link if relevant]
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows you actually listened
- Demonstrates you're iterating based on input
- Makes participation optional, not requested

### Template 3: Active Community Members
**Purpose:** Direct campaign invitation for established relationships

```
Hey [name], noticed you're super active in Nubcat community.

We're running social campaigns where $NUB holders can earn tokens for creating content about Nubcat.

Thought you might be interested: [link]

$[X]-[Y] depending on follower count, first-come-first-served until budget runs out.

Let me know if you have questions!
```

**When to use:** Only after you've already established some relationship (they know who you are)

## Volume Guidelines

### Week 1: Listening Tour
- **Target:** 10-15 DMs total
- **Focus:** Feedback, not participation
- **Success:** >30% response rate, quality insights

### Week 2: If Feedback is Positive
- **Target:** 15-20 DMs
- **Focus:** Mix of feedback + participation invites
- **Success:** 5-10 quality conversations, 3-5 campaign participants

### NEVER:
- ❌ Send 100+ DMs in a week (spam behavior)
- ❌ Copy-paste same message to everyone
- ❌ DM people who didn't respond the first time

---

## Response Handling

### If They Ask Questions
**Do:**
- Answer thoroughly and honestly
- Share links to campaigns/platform
- Offer to hop on call if they want
- Be available for follow-ups

**Don't:**
- Give vague answers to avoid scaring them
- Overpromise what Orggly can do
- Push them to participate immediately

### If They Give Feedback
**Do:**
- Thank them genuinely
- Ask clarifying questions
- Tell them how you'll incorporate it (or why you won't)
- Follow up when you make changes

**Don't:**
- Get defensive
- Explain why their feedback is wrong
- Ignore feedback that conflicts with your vision

### If They Say No / Not Interested
**Do:**
- Thank them for their time
- Ask if there's anything that would change their mind
- Leave door open for future

**Don't:**
- Push harder
- Ask "why not?"
- Make them feel bad

### If They Don't Respond
**Do:**
- Move on
- Maybe try again in 2-3 weeks if context changes
- Continue engaging with their public content normally

**Don't:**
- Send follow-up DM next day
- Ask "did you see my message?"
- Take it personally

## Tracking

### Keep Simple Spreadsheet
```
| Name | Handle | Date Sent | Template Used | Response? | Outcome |
|------|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------|---------|
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Response rate:** Target >30%
- **Quality feedback received:** Target 5+ actionable insights
- **Participation conversion:** Target 20% of responders
- **Time to response:** Avg <48 hours is good

### Red Flags to Watch
- Response rate <15% (you're spamming)
- People saying "stop messaging me"
- Getting blocked/reported
- No quality feedback, just polite "thanks but no"

---

## Anti-Patterns (Don't Do These)

### ❌ The Spray and Pray
```
[Sends same message to 100 people]

"Hey! Check out Orggly! Great opportunities for $NUB holders! [link]"
```
**Why it fails:** Impersonal, spammy, no relationship

### ❌ The Desperate Follow-Up
```
Day 1: "Hey, check out this campaign!"
Day 2: "Did you see my message?"
Day 3: "Just following up!"
Day 4: "Last chance to participate!"
```
**Why it fails:** Annoying, pushy, damages reputation

### ❌ The Fake Friendship
```
"Hey bro! Love your content! We should collab! I have this sick project..."
```
**Why it fails:** Transparent insincerity, people can tell

### ❌ The Wall of Text
```
[Sends 8 paragraph essay about Orggly, tokenomics, vision, roadmap...]
```
**Why it fails:** Too much too soon, overwhelming

## Monthly Review

**Questions to ask:**
1. Is response rate staying >30%?
2. Are conversations leading to actionable feedback?
3. Are any DMs converting to campaign participants?
4. Are people recognizing you in public tweets (relationship building working)?
5. Have you gotten any "stop messaging me" signals?

If any red flags, pause DMs and focus on public engagement for 1-2 weeks.
