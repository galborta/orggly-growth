# @galborta Twitter Playbook - Founder Account

**Last updated:** January 13, 2026  
**Next review:** After first 10 campaign submissions

---

## Update Log

- **Jan 13, 2026:** Initial version based on founder persona
- *[Future updates will be logged here]*

---

## Account Purpose

@galborta is Gabriel's personal founder account. It's where we:
- Share honest builder updates (wins AND failures)
- Engage authentically with Nubcat and Web3 communities
- Post product insights without corporate polish
- Build trust through transparency

**What this account is NOT:**
- A marketing channel for Orggly (that's @useOrggly)
- A hype machine (we're builder-authentic, not salesy)
- A broadcast-only account (engagement > broadcasting)

---

## Posting Frequency

**Target:** 2-3 posts per day

**Why not more?** Quality > quantity. Each post should have substance, not just filling feed.

**Mix:**
- 40% Product updates (Orggly features, campaign progress, learnings)
- 30% Nubcat engagement (quote tweets, community participation)
- 20% Web3 takes (contrarian thoughts, industry observations)
- 10% Personal (Barcelona life, techno, dog, real human stuff)

---

## Daily Rhythm

### Morning (9-11am Barcelona time)
**Post type:** Update or reflection

Examples:
- "GM. Launching update: [honest status on campaigns]"
- "Woke up thinking about [product insight]"
- "Week 1 of Nubcat campaign: [real metrics, no fluff]"

### Afternoon (2-5pm Barcelona time)
**Activity type:** Engagement

Examples:
- Quote tweet Nubcat community content (5-10x daily during campaign)
- Reply to comments on your posts
- Join Nubcat Twitter Spaces if happening

### Evening (8-10pm Barcelona time)
**Post type:** Reflection or personal

Examples:
- "Today's learning: [what didn't work and why]"
- "Built [feature] after 8hr session. Here's what I learned..."
- "Honest take on [Web3 topic]"

## Voice & Tone

### What We Sound Like
- **Builder-authentic:** "I built this, here's why it broke"
- **Transparent:** "Cold launch failed. Here's why."
- **Technical when relevant:** "Escrow uses PDAs for..."
- **Accessible when not:** "Think of it like Fiverr but..."
- **Excited but honest:** "Excited to launch, also nervous because..."

### What We DON'T Sound Like
- **Marketer-polished:** "Thrilled to announce..."
- **Overly formal:** "We are pleased to inform..."
- **Hype without substance:** "This will change everything!"
- **Corporate PR:** "Orggly is revolutionizing..."
- **Desperate:** "Please RT!" "Ser, wen moon?"

## Content Templates

### Campaign Update Template
```
[Honest status opener]

[1-2 sentences on what's happening]

[1 sentence on what we're learning]

[Optional: Link or CTA]
```

Example:
> Week 1 of Nubcat campaign complete.
> 
> 15 participants, $8,200 paid in $NUB, 120K impressions across submissions.
> 
> Biggest learning: Quote tweet requirement raised quality but lowered volume. Considering hybrid approach for next campaign.

### User Spotlight Template
```
[Why this person's submission stood out]

[Quote or highlight from their work]

[What it shows about the community]
```

Example:
> This Nubcat submission from @[user] is exactly what we're looking for.
> 
> They didn't just retweet. They explained why 12 years of organic history matters in a market full of pump-and-dump schemes.
> 
> This is what $NUB holders bringing thoughtful energy looks like.

### Learning Template
```
[What we tried]

[What happened]

[What we're changing]
```

Example:
> Tried cold-launching campaigns before building relationships with Nubcat community.
> 
> Result: 200 views, 1 like, 0 submissions in 48 hours.
> 
> Pivoting to listening tour - DM'ing holders for feedback, not participation.

## Engagement Strategy

### When Someone Submits to Campaign
1. **Quote tweet their submission** within 2 hours
2. Add genuine commentary on what made it good
3. Tag them and thank them

### When Someone Replies to Your Tweets
1. **Reply to ALL comments** within 24 hours (even critical ones)
2. Never defensive, always curious
3. If they're wrong, explain why politely
4. If they're right, thank them and say what you're changing

### When Nubcat Community Posts
1. **Quote tweet 5-10x daily** during active campaigns
2. Add your genuine take (no Orggly mentions unless asked)
3. Build presence before asking for anything

## What NOT to Post

### Never:
- ❌ Generic inspiration quotes
- ❌ Pure pitches ("Check out Orggly!")
- ❌ Hiding problems
- ❌ Dunking on competitors
- ❌ Engagement bait ("RT if you agree!")

### Avoid:
- ⚠️ Posting just to post
- ⚠️ Bragging without metrics
- ⚠️ Talking about features before they work
- ⚠️ Making promises you can't keep

## Crisis Response

### When Something Breaks
1. **Acknowledge immediately**
2. **Explain what happened**

### When Someone is Unhappy
1. **Listen first, defend never**
2. **Ask clarifying questions**
3. **Acknowledge their perspective**
4. **Share what you'll change (if anything)**
