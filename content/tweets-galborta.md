## Drafts (Ready to Post)

### Draft 1: Cold Launch Honesty

```
GM. Launching update:

Put Nubcat campaigns live yesterday. 23K $NUB budget, article explaining everything, ready to go.

Traction: 200 views, 1 like, 0 submissions.

I know why - launched before building relationships with the community.

So I'm starting over, but differently: ðŸ§µ

1/ This week = listening tour

Not asking anyone to use Orggly yet. Just want to understand:
• What Nubcat holders actually need
• Whether these campaigns make sense
• What I'm missing

2/ The campaigns are staying live, budget is there.

But I'm not pushing participation until I've earned trust with this community.

Building infrastructure for communities means being part of the community first.

Let's see if I can do this right.
```

**Content Pillar:** Product/Learning  
**Timing:** Today (January 13), morning  
**Purpose:** Acknowledge failure, build credibility through transparency

### Draft 2: Nubcat IP Appreciation

```
12 years of organic meme history. 250k+ Instagram followers before $NUB existed.

Leon Karssen kept creating Nubcat for over a decade with zero financial incentive. Through platform changes, algorithm shifts, trends coming and going.

That's not hype. That's culture.

This is why we chose Nubcat for the first Orggly campaign.
```

**Content Pillar:** Nubcat engagement  
**Timing:** Afternoon (2-5pm Barcelona)  
**Purpose:** Show understanding of Nubcat's value, build community credibility

---

### Draft 3: Product Explainer

```
Social Jobs on Orggly: You set follower tiers (0-1K gets $8, 50K+ gets $90), workers pick their tier, submit tweets, get paid.

First-come-first-served. All escrow. Quote tweets with commentary (not bot retweets).

Communities can pay holders in their own tokens to create authentic content.

That's the model.
```

**Content Pillar:** Product education  
**Timing:** Evening (8-10pm Barcelona)  
**Purpose:** Explain mechanics simply for newcomers

---

### Draft 4: Why Solana

```
Built Orggly on Solana for practical reasons:

If you're paying someone $15 for a social post, $3 gas fees kill the model.

Nubcat is on Solana, so that's where we started.

Consumer crypto needs this kind of UX.

Not ideological. Just practical.
```

**Content Pillar:** Web3 take  
**Timing:** Flexible  
**Purpose:** Address "why Solana" without tribalism

---

### Draft 5: Communities Need Tools

```
Most token communities die because they have no way to coordinate beyond Telegram hype chats.

We have thousands of groups launching. They need infrastructure to actually work together.

Twitter is where you spread the word.

Orggly is where you build the thing worth spreading.
```

**Content Pillar:** Thesis/vision  
**Timing:** Flexible  
**Purpose:** Articulate core belief about community coordination
