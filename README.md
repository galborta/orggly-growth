## What This Is

This repository is the **single source of truth** for Orggly's marketing and growth operations. It's not static documentation - it's a living system that changes based on what we learn from every campaign, every conversation, every experiment.

**Current focus:** Launching Orggly's first campaign with the Nubcat memecoin community on Solana.

## Operating Principles

### 1. NOW.md is Source of Truth
If it's not in NOW.md, it's not a current priority. Update NOW.md FIRST when anything changes.

### 2. Document Everything (Wins AND Fails)
Failures are more valuable than wins if we learn from them. Log both immediately in tracking/.

### 3. Archive, Don't Delete
When something is outdated, move it to the bottom of the file. Never delete history.

### 4. Transparency > Perfection
Better to admit "cold launch failed, pivoting" than pretend everything is working.

### 5. Iterate Based on Data, Not Assumptions
Every experiment in tracking/experiments.md must have measurable success criteria.

## Current Campaign: Nubcat Launch

**Status:** Day 1 - Campaigns live, pivoting from cold launch to listening tour

**Context:**
- Orggly is a decentralized jobs platform on Solana
- First campaign: Nubcat community (memecoin with 12-year history, $10.5M mcap)
- Founder: Gabriel Alborta (@galborta on Twitter), based in Barcelona
- Platform accounts: @galborta (founder), @useOrggly (brand)
- Focus: Social Jobs feature (pay community members in $NUB to create content)

**What We're Learning:**
- Cold launch (campaigns → DMs → submissions) didn't work
- Need to build relationships first before asking for participation
- Community doesn't know who we are yet

**Current Approach:**
- Listening tour: DM 10-15 Nubcat holders for feedback (not participation)
- Engage in Nubcat spaces without mentioning Orggly
- Earn trust before inviting participation

See **NOW.md** for detailed current state.
