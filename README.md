# Orggly Marketing Command Center

This repository is Gabriel's strategic brain for Orggly marketing and growth. It's a living system that evolves based on what's actually happening, not rigid plans.

## 🎯 Current Phase

**Nubcat Launch - Week 1**
- 3 social campaigns live
- $23,100 in $NUB budget
- Building relationships with community
- Testing quote tweet campaigns for TOS safety

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Need to do marketing right now?**
1. Read [NOW.md](NOW.md) - Shows current situation and top 3 next actions
2. Reference relevant playbook in `/playbooks/`
3. Check voice guide in `/strategy/` to stay on-brand
4. Execute and update NOW.md with results

**Need to create content?**
1. Check [NOW.md](NOW.md) for current context
2. Read [strategy/founder-voice.md](strategy/founder-voice.md) or [strategy/brand-voice.md](strategy/brand-voice.md)
3. Use templates from relevant playbook
4. Draft in `/content/` files
5. Post and archive with performance notes

## 📂 Structure

```
├── NOW.md ⭐ - Single source of truth for current state
├── /strategy/ - Vision, voice, messaging frameworks
├── /playbooks/ - How to execute on different channels
├── /tracking/ - Campaigns, experiments, wins, fails
├── /updates/ - Weekly summaries (when you have time)
└── /content/ - Tweet drafts and archives
```

## 🎭 The Two Voices

**@galborta (Founder Account)**
- Builder-authentic, transparent, personal
- Posts 2-3x daily
- Engages directly with community
- [Voice Guide](strategy/founder-voice.md) | [Playbook](playbooks/twitter-galborta.md)

**@useOrggly (Brand Account)**
- Professional, data-driven, product-focused
- Posts 1x daily max
- Announcements and metrics
- [Voice Guide](strategy/brand-voice.md) | [Playbook](playbooks/twitter-useorggly.md)

## 📊 How This Works

**Flexible, not rigid:**
- Update when things change, not on a schedule
- Some weeks lots of activity, some weeks minimal
- NOW.md is the only file that MUST stay current

**Captures learnings:**
- What worked → `/tracking/wins.md`
- What failed → `/tracking/fails.md`
- Experiments → `/tracking/experiments.md`

**Evolves strategy:**
- Strategy docs update when we learn something big
- Playbooks update when we find better tactics
- NOW.md keeps everything grounded in reality

## 🔄 Typical Workflow

### Got 30 min for marketing?
1. Open NOW.md (2 min)
2. Do highest priority action (20 min)
3. Update NOW.md (5 min)
4. Log any learnings in `/tracking/` (3 min)

### Got time for content creation?
1. Check NOW.md for context
2. Reference voice guide
3. Draft 3-5 tweets in `/content/`
4. Schedule/post throughout week

### Weekly check-in (30 min on Sunday)
1. Create update in `/updates/`
2. Review NOW.md - still accurate?
3. Check experiments - any conclusions?
4. Plan next week's top 3 actions

## 📈 Success Metrics

**This repo is working if:**
- You reference NOW.md before any marketing activity
- You know what to do when you have 30 free minutes
- Learnings actually change your approach
- You don't repeat failed tactics
- Content sounds authentically like Gabriel/Orggly

**It's failing if:**
- NOW.md is weeks out of date
- You do marketing randomly without checking it
- You forget what you already tested
- It feels like a chore instead of a tool

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Reality over plans** - Document what's happening, adjust based on truth
2. **Quality over volume** - Better to post 1 great tweet than 5 mediocre ones
3. **Relationships over broadcasting** - Community first, promotion second
4. **Learning over perfection** - Every experiment produces useful data
5. **Authenticity over polish** - Sound like Gabriel, not a marketing team
