# NOW - Current State & Priorities

**Last updated:** January 13, 2026  
**Next update:** After completing Top 3 actions or when major change occurs  
**Update frequency:** Daily during active campaigns, weekly during planning

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

This is your SINGLE source of truth for current priorities.

- Update this FIRST when anything changes (new traction, pivot, learning)
- Archive old "Top 3" to bottom when completing them
- Keep "Where We Are" ruthlessly current (delete outdated context)

---

## Where We Are

**Campaign Status:** Nubcat launch - Day 1, campaigns ready, building relationships first

**Platform State:** 3 social jobs live on Orggly, all campaign pages functional, payment infrastructure tested

**Community Position:** New to Nubcat community, no established relationships yet, need to earn trust before asking for participation

---

---

## Current Traction

**Twitter Metrics (Last 24hr):**
- Tweet views: 200
- Engagement: 1 like
- Campaign submissions: 0
- DM responses: Cold launch approach failed

**What This Means:** Broadcasting without relationships = invisible. Community doesn't know who we are yet.

---

## What's Working

*(TBD - nothing proven yet, just launched)*

---

## What's Not Working

**Cold Launch Approach:**
- Posted campaign announcements before building any community relationships
- Sent DMs with campaign links to people who don't know Orggly
- Result: Near-zero visibility, no submissions, felt like outsider pitching

**Broadcasting Without Presence:**
- Launched campaigns without being active in Nubcat Telegram/Twitter spaces
- Community has no context for who Gabriel/Orggly is
- No trust foundation to ask for participation

---

## Current Hypothesis

**Old approach (failed):** Launch campaigns → DM holders → get submissions  
**New approach (testing):** Listening tour → build trust → earn participation

**The pivot:** Spend 2 weeks just listening and engaging with Nubcat community before pushing campaign participation. Focus on:
1. Understanding what Nubcat holders actually want from $NUB utility
2. Building relationships with 10-15 active community members
3. Getting feedback on whether these campaigns even make sense
4. Earning the right to invite participation

---

## Top 3 Next Actions

### 1. START LISTENING TOUR - DM 10-15 Nubcat holders for FEEDBACK (not participation)
**Why:** Need to understand community needs before asking them to do anything  
**Template:** "Hey [name], saw [specific thing]. I built Orggly for communities like Nubcat. Would love 10 min of your feedback on what we built. Not pitching participation, genuinely want to know if this makes sense to holders."  
**Target:** 10-15 DMs over next 3 days  
**Success:** >30% response rate, quality feedback received

### 2. POST HONEST "COLD LAUNCH" TWEET - Acknowledge mistake, pivot to relationship building
**Why:** Transparency builds trust, shows we're learning  
**Draft:** See content/tweets-galborta.md - Draft 1  
**Timing:** Today (January 13)  
**Success:** Community appreciates honesty, conversation starts

### 3. ENGAGE IN NUBCAT SPACES - Quote tweet community content, NO Orggly mentions
**Why:** Build presence and context before asking anything  
**Target:** 5-10 quote tweets per day of Nubcat content  
**Rule:** Zero Orggly mentions for first week, just genuine engagement  
**Success:** Community starts recognizing @galborta handle

## Open Questions

1. **What do Nubcat holders actually want from $NUB utility?**  
   - Is paid content creation solving a real need?
   - Or is this a solution looking for a problem?

2. **Are follower tiers ($8-$90) right for this community?**  
   - Most Nubcat holders are <5K followers
   - Should we add more granularity at lower tiers?

3. **Should we compress campaign timeline (48hr→24hr)?**  
   - Does 48hr submission window create too much delay?
   - Would urgency help or hurt quality?

4. **Is quote tweet requirement too high a barrier?**  
   - Do people want to just retweet, not create original content?
   - Are we over-optimizing for Twitter TOS at expense of participation?

## Key Metrics This Week

**Primary:**
- DM response rate (Target: >30%)
- Quality of feedback received (Target: Actionable insights from 5+ people)
- First organic submissions (Target: 5 submissions without outbound push)

**Secondary:**
- @galborta quote tweet engagement (Target: 2-3 replies per quote tweet)
- Nubcat Telegram presence (Target: Recognized as regular member)
- Campaign page views (Target: 100+ views from organic discovery)

---

## Blockers

**None currently** - We have budget, platform works, campaigns are live. Only blocker was our own approach (broadcasting vs relationships), which we're fixing.

---

## This Week's Focus

**Single Goal:** Build 10-15 real relationships with Nubcat community members and earn the right to invite them to participate.

**Not:** Get submissions at any cost  
**Yes:** Understand community, build trust, get feedback, iterate based on learnings
