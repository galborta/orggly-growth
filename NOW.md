## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

This is your SINGLE source of truth for current priorities.

- Update this FIRST when anything changes (new traction, pivot, learning)
- Archive old "Top 3" to bottom when completing them
- Keep "Where We Are" ruthlessly current (delete outdated context)

## Where We Are

**Campaign Status:** Nubcat launch - Day 2, FIRST SUBMISSIONS RECEIVED 🎉

**Platform State:** 4 campaigns live (3 social jobs + 1 banner contest), payment infrastructure proven to work, raised follower minimum to 500

**Community Position:** Still new to Nubcat community, but now have proof of payment. 3 participants have engaged with the platform (1 social job + 2 banner designers)

**Major shift:** Went from 0 submissions yesterday to 3 today. First payment sent (509 $NUB). System works.

## Current Traction

**Today's Wins:**
- First social job submission paid (509 $NUB)
- 2 banner design submissions received
- Tweeted about first payment from both @galborta and @useOrggly
- Proved payment infrastructure works end-to-end
- Participant helped find bugs in submission flow

**Metrics:**
- Campaign submissions: 3 (up from 0 yesterday)
- Payments sent: 1 (509 $NUB)
- Total participants: 3 unique people
- Banner contest: 2 early submissions with 5d 21h remaining

**What This Means:** The system works. People will engage. We just needed to get the first one over the line.

---

## What's Working

**Paying despite imperfect submissions:** First participant didn't follow guidelines perfectly, but we paid them anyway because they helped find bugs. This shows flexibility and follow-through.

**Banner contest getting traction:** 2 submissions in first 24 hours shows there's interest in higher-effort creative work with bigger prizes.

**Celebrating submissions publicly:** Tweeted from both accounts about first payment. Creates social proof that we actually pay.

---

## What's Not Working

**Guidelines still being ignored:** First submission was "Interesting read 👀" instead of thoughtful 50+ character commentary. Need to make guidelines clearer or accept that people will do minimum viable effort.

**Follower minimums:** First participant had 40 followers (we've now raised minimum to 500). Need to enforce this going forward.

**Missing designer contact info:** Don't have Twitter handles for the 2 banner designers. Need to add handle request to submission form.

---

## Current Hypothesis

**Original hypothesis (failed):** Launch campaigns → get submissions  
**Yesterday's pivot:** Listening tour → build trust → earn participation  
**Today's learning:** Just needed to break the ice. First submission creates momentum.

**New hypothesis:** First payment is social proof that unlocks more participation. Now that someone has been paid, others will feel safer submitting. The listening tour is still valuable, but we don't need to wait 2 weeks - we can do both in parallel.

**Testing:** Continue listening tour DMs while monitoring if submission rate increases now that we have proof of payment.

## Top 3 Next Actions

### 1. GET TWITTER HANDLES FROM BANNER DESIGNERS - Follow up in submission
**Why:** We tweeted about their designs but can't tag them. Need handles to give proper credit and pay winner.  
**How:** Reply to their submissions asking for Twitter handle  
**Timeline:** Today  
**Success:** Both designers provide handles, we update tweet to tag them

### 2. CONTINUE LISTENING TOUR - DM 5 more Nubcat holders for feedback
**Why:** Still need community relationships, but now we have proof point to share  
**New angle:** "We just paid our first participant 509 $NUB. Before scaling, want feedback from actual holders on if this makes sense."  
**Target:** 5 DMs over next 2 days  
**Success:** >30% response rate, feedback on campaign structure

### 3. MONITOR BANNER CONTEST - Watch for new submissions, engage with designers
**Why:** Contest ends in 5d 21h, want to maximize participation  
**How:** Check submissions daily, reply to designers with appreciation, consider sharing work-in-progress if they post it  
**Success:** 3-5 total submissions by contest end

## Open Questions

1. **Should we enforce guideline quality or accept minimum effort?**  
   - First submission was low-effort but person helped find bugs
   - Do we want thoughtful commentary or just reach/impressions?
   - Maybe create two tiers: basic retweet vs thoughtful commentary?

2. **Are 500 followers the right minimum?**  
   - Raised from 0 to 500 today
   - Will this kill participation or improve quality?
   - Monitor submission rate over next week

3. **How do we get designer Twitter handles in submission flow?**  
   - Current form doesn't ask for it
   - Need this for tagging and winner announcement
   - Add to form or follow up manually?

4. **Should we create more banner contests vs social jobs?**  
   - Banner got 2 submissions faster than social jobs
   - Higher effort but bigger prize = better quality?
   - Or just because it's novel/creative vs repetitive tweets?

## Key Metrics This Week

**Primary:**
- Total submissions across all campaigns (Target: 10 by week end)
- Banner contest submissions (Target: 5 total by deadline)
- Social job submissions on Campaigns 2 & 3 (Target: 2-3 each)

**Secondary:**
- DM response rate from listening tour (Target: >30%)
- Twitter engagement on payment announcement tweets (replies, QTs)
- Community recognition in Nubcat spaces

---

## Blockers

**Designer contact info:** Can't properly credit banner designers without their Twitter handles. Need to add this to submission flow.

**Form updates needed:** Should add Twitter handle field to all submission forms, not just rely on platform username.

---

## This Week's Focus

**Dual approach:**
1. **Prove the model works:** Get 5-10 more submissions across campaigns, show consistent payments
2. **Build relationships:** Continue listening tour with updated proof point (we just paid someone)

**Not:** Wait for perfect participation before proving the system  
**Yes:** Run campaigns AND relationship building in parallel
