# Current State - January 12, 2026

## Where We Are
- **Phase:** Nubcat launch - Day 1
- **Active campaigns:** 3 social jobs ($23,100 $NUB total budget)
- **Traction:** 0 submissions, $0 paid, 0 participants
- **Momentum:** 🔴 Not started yet

**Reality check:**
Launched campaigns with article, got minimal engagement (200 views, 1 like). Core issue: launched cold without building relationships first. Need to pivot from "launch and push" to "listen and invite."

## What's Working Right Now
- Nothing yet - just launched
- Article is published and establishes credibility
- Campaigns are live and functional
- Have clarity on the mistake (cold launch)

## What's Not Working
- Cold outreach/broadcasting isn't generating participation
- Zero relationship foundation with Nubcat community
- Posting about campaigns without context or trust

## Top 3 Next Actions (Do These Next)

### 1. START LISTENING TOUR (Highest Priority)
**Action:** DM 10-15 active Nubcat community members for feedback (not participation)
- **Who:** Holders who engage with Nubcat content, 1K+ followers preferred
- **Message:** "Building Orggly for communities like Nubcat. Can I get 10 min of your feedback? Not pitching, genuinely want to know if this makes sense."
- **Goal:** Understand community needs, build relationships, get feedback on campaigns
- **Playbook:** [playbooks/dm-outreach.md](playbooks/dm-outreach.md)

### 2. POST HONEST "COLD LAUNCH" TWEET FROM @GALBORTA
**Action:** Acknowledge the launch mistake publicly, share new approach
- **Content:** See [content/tweets-galborta.md](content/tweets-galborta.md) for draft
- **Why:** Transparency builds trust, creates followable narrative, gives permission to start over
- **Playbook:** [playbooks/twitter-galborta.md](playbooks/twitter-galborta.md)

### 3. ENGAGE IN NUBCAT SPACES (NO ORGGLY MENTIONS)
**Action:** Quote tweet 5-10 Nubcat community posts with genuine takes
- **Where:** Nubcat Twitter, Nubcat Telegram (@nubportal)
- **What:** Appreciate art, comment on IP model, discuss Leon's work
- **Don't:** Mention Orggly unless someone explicitly asks
- **Playbook:** [playbooks/community.md](playbooks/community.md)

## Open Questions
- What do Nubcat holders actually want from $NUB utility?
- Are quote tweet campaigns interesting to them or feels like work?
- What's the right compensation for this community specifically?
- Should we adjust follower tiers based on Nubcat holder distribution?
- Is the timeline (48hr submission, 72hr engagement, 120hr review) too long?

## Recent Insights
- **Cold launch doesn't work** - No relationship foundation = no participation
- **Lurkers are watching** - 200 views means people saw it, just not compelled to act
- **Article establishes credibility** - Good foundation piece, but not enough alone
- **Need feedback before participation** - Must earn right to ask for action

## Key Metrics to Track
- DM response rate (target: >30%)
- Quality of feedback received
- Organic Nubcat community engagement (replies, follows)
- When first submission comes in (and why they participated)
- Campaign budget utilization rate

## This Week's Focus
**Primary goal:** Build 10-15 real relationships with Nubcat community members

**Success looks like:**
- 10+ DM conversations with quality feedback
- Understanding community's actual needs
- First organic submissions coming from relationships, not broadcasting
- Nubcat community recognizing @galborta as genuine, not transactional

## Next Update
When something significant changes:
- First submission comes in
- Substantial feedback from listening tour
- Pivot tactics based on learnings
- Or weekly (Sunday, Jan 19)
