# NOW - Current State & Priorities

**Last updated:** January 14, 2026 (Campaign went viral!)  
**Next update:** When review/payment process begins  
**Update frequency:** Daily during active campaigns, weekly during planning

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

This is your SINGLE source of truth for current priorities.

- Update this FIRST when anything changes (new traction, pivot, learning)
- Archive old "Top 3" to bottom when completing them
- Keep "Where We Are" ruthlessly current (delete outdated context)

---

## Where We Are

**Campaign Status:** VIRAL - 845 participants, 675 article retweets, now in review phase

**Platform State:** Had to patch multiple bugs while scaling from 3 to 845 submissions. Payment infrastructure works but review process wasn't ready for this scale.

**Community Position:** Nubcat community fully engaged. Article went viral, massive participation, now need to deliver on payment promise at scale.

**Major shift:** Day 1: 3 submissions. Day 3: 845 submissions. Model validated. Trust + viral article = massive participation. Now challenge is review infrastructure.

---

## Active Campaigns - VIRAL RESPONSE

### Campaign 1-3: Nubcat Social Jobs (Combined)
- **Total participants:** 845 submissions across all 3 campaigns
- **Article retweets:** 675
- **Budget available:** ~10,000 $NUB for distribution
- **Status:** 🔴 IN REVIEW - Need to filter for guideline compliance
- **Payment approach:** First-come-first-served for those who followed rules, until budget depletes

### Campaign 4: Twitter Banner Design Contest
- **Status:** Still running, deadline in a few days
- **Prize:** 10,000 $NUB
- **Submissions:** TBD (tracking separately from social jobs)

---

## Current Situation

**What just happened:**
- Campaign article went viral (675 retweets)
- Got 845 participants in social campaigns
- Went from worrying about getting submissions to managing review at scale
- Had to fix multiple platform bugs while submissions poured in
- Model validated: trust + engaged community + viral content = massive participation

**Current bottleneck:**
- Review infrastructure wasn't built for 845 submissions
- Need to filter for guideline compliance manually
- Payment distribution needs to be systematic (first-come-first-served)
- ~10,000 $NUB budget means not everyone gets paid

---

## What's Working

**The model works at scale:** Once you prove payment (even once), engaged communities will participate massively when content goes viral.

**Platform holds up:** Despite bugs, the core submission and payment flow worked. Fixed issues as they came up.

**Community engagement:** Nubcat holders are active and willing to participate. Not a trust issue anymore.

---

## What's Not Working

**Review at scale:** Didn't have infrastructure ready to review 845 submissions. This is now the bottleneck.

**Quality distribution is wide:** Expect ~20% to have ignored guidelines completely. Need systematic filtering.

**Budget constraints:** ~10,000 $NUB for 845 participants means average would be ~11.8 $NUB per person if everyone gets paid. Need to filter and prioritize.

---

## Current Hypothesis

**Validated:** Trust barrier was the real blocker. Once proven, communities participate at scale when:
1. You have proof of payment
2. Article/content goes viral
3. Community is engaged (not just any token)
4. Participation is low-friction (quote tweet vs essay)

**New learning:** Viral campaigns create review bottleneck. Next time, need automated quality checks or community moderation BEFORE launching at scale.

**Testing now:** Can we review and pay 845 submissions fairly with manual process? Or do we need to build review tools first?

---

## Top 3 Next Actions

### 1. BUILD REVIEW PROCESS - Create systematic way to filter 845 submissions
**Why:** Can't manually review 845 without system. Need clear criteria and workflow.  
**How:** 
- Define clear pass/fail criteria (followed guidelines? proper format? enough followers?)
- Create spreadsheet or tool to track review progress
- Sort by submission timestamp (first-come-first-served)
- Calculate payment tiers based on quality and budget
**Timeline:** This week  
**Success:** Have reviewable system, can start processing submissions systematically

### 2. REVIEW AND CATEGORIZE - Go through submissions in batches
**Why:** Need to identify who followed rules, who didn't, quality tiers  
**How:**
- Batch review in groups of 50-100
- Tag: Tier 1 (excellent), Tier 2 (good), Tier 3 (basic but valid), Rejected
- Track timestamp for first-come-first-served within each tier
**Timeline:** Over next few days  
**Success:** All 845 submissions categorized and payment amounts calculated

### 3. DISTRIBUTE PAYMENTS - Execute payment run for approved submissions
**Why:** Need to deliver on promise. This is the moment that matters.  
**How:**
- Start with Tier 1 submissions (timestamp order)
- Continue through tiers until budget depletes
- Document and announce completion
**Timeline:** After review complete  
**Success:** ~10,000 $NUB distributed fairly, community sees we delivered

## Open Questions

1. **What's the review criteria?**  
   - Followed guidelines (quote tweet, 50+ chars, #sponsored, $NUB mention)?
   - Minimum follower count (500)?
   - Quality of commentary?
   - Tweet still live?

2. **How to handle quality tiers with limited budget?**
   - Pay excellent submissions more than basic ones?
   - Or equal payment to all who followed rules until budget depletes?
   - First-come-first-served within each tier?

3. **Should we announce review process publicly?**
   - Let community know we're reviewing and when to expect payments?
   - Or stay quiet until ready to pay?
   - Transparency vs managing expectations?

4. **What tools do we need for next viral campaign?**
   - Automated guideline checking?
   - Community moderation/voting?
   - Payment calculator based on budget?

## Key Metrics This Week

**Primary:**
- Submissions reviewed: 0/845 (Target: all reviewed by week end)
- Payments distributed: 0/~10,000 $NUB (Target: complete distribution this week)
- Review accuracy: TBD (Target: <5% appeals/disputes)

**Secondary:**
- Platform bugs fixed during viral response: [track count]
- Community sentiment during review period
- Time to complete review process (learning for next time)

---

## This Week's Focus

**REVIEW AND DELIVER**

The model is validated. Now it's about execution. Review 845 submissions fairly, distribute payments to those who followed rules, and prove we can handle viral success.

**Not:** Panic about scale or cut corners on review  
**Yes:** Build systematic process, be fair, deliver on promises, document learnings for next time
