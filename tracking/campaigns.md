## Submission Log

### Submission #1 - Campaign 1: "Why Nubcat Is Underrated"

**Participant:** [Handle withheld - 40 followers]  
**Submitted:** January 13, 2026  
**Follower tier:** 0-500 (40 followers - below minimum)  
**Base payment:** 509 $NUB  
**Impressions:** N/A  
**Impression bonus:** $0  
**Total payment:** 509 $NUB  
**Tweet content:** "Interesting read 👀 Excited to see where this goes. @orggly @useOrggly $NUB"

**Quality notes:**  
Did NOT follow guidelines (was supposed to quote tweet with thoughtful commentary 50+ chars, this was just generic hype). Also below new 500 follower minimum. However, participant helped identify platform bugs during submission process, so we paid them as a thank you for QA work. This wasn't a quality submission by campaign standards, but showed flexibility to reward helpful community members. Would not accept similar submissions going forward unless they also contribute non-content value.

**Approved:** January 13, 2026 - Paid despite not meeting guidelines (bug finder reward)
