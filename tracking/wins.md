# Wins Tracking

**Update frequency:** Immediately when something works

---

## HOW TO USE

- Document wins with specifics (not vague "good progress")
- Include actual metrics
- Analyze WHY it worked
- Define how to repeat/scale

**Remember:** A win without analysis is just luck. Make it repeatable.

## Example Format

### Win #1: DM Feedback Conversation Led to First Submission

**Date:** January 15, 2026

**What we did:**
- DM'd @example_user asking for feedback (not participation)
- Had 10 min conversation about their needs
- Incorporated their suggestion about tier structure
- Followed up 2 days later mentioning they could participate if interested

**Result:**
- They submitted high-quality tweet
- Earned $25 $NUB
- Their submission got 2,300 impressions
- They thanked us for listening to feedback first

**Why it worked:**
- Asked for feedback before asking for action
- Actually incorporated their input (showed we listen)
- Made participation optional, not pushy
- Built real relationship over 3-day period

**Key insight:**
People participate when they feel heard and valued, not when you just ask them to do something.

**How to repeat:**
1. DM for feedback with specific question
2. Have real conversation (not transactional)
3. Incorporate feedback visibly
4. Follow up later with optional participation invite
5. Thank them regardless of whether they participate

**How to scale:**
- This approach works, but can't scale to 100+ people
- Target: 20-30 quality relationships per campaign
- Prioritize active community members
- Depth over breadth
