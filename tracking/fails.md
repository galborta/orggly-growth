# Failures Tracking

**Update frequency:** Immediately when something doesn't work

## HOW TO USE

- Document failures quickly (don't hide them)
- Analyze WHY it failed (root cause)
- Specify what NOT to repeat
- Define better approach for next time

**Remember:** Failures are more valuable than wins if we learn from them.

## Week 1 Failures

### Fail #1: Cold Launch Without Relationships

**Date:** January 13, 2026

**What we did:**
- Launched 3 campaigns with $23,100 $NUB budget
- Posted announcement tweets from @galborta and @useOrggly
- Sent ~30 DMs with campaign links to Nubcat holders
- Expected: Immediate submissions from excited community

**Result:**
- Tweet views: 200
- Engagement: 1 like total
- Submissions: 0
- DM response rate: ~15%
- Time elapsed: 48 hours

**Why it failed:**
- NO trust foundation with Nubcat community
- Community doesn't know who Gabriel/Orggly is
- Asking for action without earning the right
- Treated community as distribution channel, not people
- Skipped relationship-building phase entirely

**Root cause:**
Assumed "good product + budget" = automatic adoption. Ignored that communities need to trust you before they'll participate in anything you create.

**Don't repeat:**
- ❌ Never launch to community you haven't engaged with first
- ❌ Don't send campaign DMs to people who don't know you
- ❌ Don't expect participation without building presence first
- ❌ Don't treat communities as distribution channels

**Instead do:**
âœ… Spend 1-2 weeks engaging in community spaces BEFORE asking anything
âœ… Build relationships through feedback conversations first
âœ… Earn recognition as community member before promoting product
âœ… Let trust precede requests

**What we're changing:**
- Pivoted to "listening tour" approach (see experiments.md)
- DM'ing for feedback, not participation
- Goal: 10-15 real relationships before pushing campaigns again

### Fail #2: Broadcasting Without Engaging

**Date:** January 13, 2026

**What we did:**
- Posted about Orggly campaigns on @galborta
- Shared campaign links
- Made announcements from @useOrggly
- Did NOT engage in Nubcat Telegram
- Did NOT quote tweet Nubcat community content
- Did NOT participate in Nubcat Twitter Spaces

**Result:**
- Felt like outsider pitching product
- Minimal visibility in community
- No organic discussion about Orggly
- Posts got ignored

**Why it failed:**
- Community has no context for who we are
- We showed up just to promote, not to participate
- Gave nothing to community before asking for something
- Led with product instead of presence

**Root cause:**
Treating Twitter as broadcast medium instead of conversation space. You can't build community trust by shouting into the void.

**Don't repeat:**
- ❌ Don't lead with product announcements
- ❌ Don't post only when you want something
- ❌ Don't skip community participation
- ❌ Don't treat community spaces as advertising channels

**Instead do:**
âœ… Spend 2hrs/day in Nubcat spaces (Telegram, Twitter) with ZERO Orggly mentions first
âœ… Quote tweet Nubcat content 5-10x daily
âœ… Reply to community discussions genuinely
âœ… Be helpful/insightful without agenda
âœ… Build reputation as valuable community member

**What we're changing:**
- Daily engagement in Nubcat Telegram (check 3x, contribute 1x every 2 days)
- Quote tweeting Nubcat content without mentioning Orggly
- Focus on being present before promoting
