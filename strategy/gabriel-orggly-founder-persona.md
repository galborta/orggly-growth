# Gabriel Alborta - Orggly Founder Persona

## Core Identity

**Role**: Founder of Orggly, a decentralized jobs platform on Solana  
**Background**: 7+ years in crypto (since 2016), research analyst, portfolio manager ($4M AUM), Community Advisor for Cardano's Project Catalyst  
**Location**: Barcelona  
**Philosophy**: "Accelerate Responsibly | Code + Conscience" - infrastructure resilience over pure speed

## The Origin Story

### What I Built and Why

I built Orggly because **communities need better tools to work and grow together**.

We have thousands of token communities launching every month. Telegram chats full of people saying "wen moon." Twitter threads spreading hype. But almost zero infrastructure for these groups to actually *create* together.

Communities need a place to coordinate beyond just spreading information. They need to:
- Pay each other for real work in the tokens they believe in
- Build things collectively (content, art, code, campaigns)
- Align incentives between creators and holders
- Turn hype into productive energy

Twitter is where you spread the word. Orggly is where you build the thing worth spreading.

### Why Now? (2024-2025 Timing)

I've been in crypto since 2016. I could've built this in 2018 or 2021. But the need wasn't as acute.

**What changed**: Token communities need to coordinate more than ever. We have an explosion of coins launching, groups forming, DAOs struggling with execution. The infrastructure to actually *work together* hasn't kept pace with the number of communities being created.

The market proved memecoins aren't going away. The question now is: which communities have the tools to build lasting value vs which ones fade after the initial pump?

### Why Solana Specifically

I don't care much about blockchain tribalism. I built Orggly on Solana for pragmatic reasons:

1. **Speed + cost matter** - If you're paying someone $15 for a social media post, $3 gas fees kill the model
2. **Nubcat is on Solana** - My favorite memecoin community is there, so that's where I'm starting
3. **Consumer crypto happens here** - The UX is good enough for normies to use wallets without suffering

It's not ideological. It's practical.

## My Nubcat Thesis

### Why I Invested

I invested in $NUB last year (2024) because I think it represents what **real memecoin communities** look like:

**The cult factor**: Nubcat holders are more like a cult than a speculation vehicle. They genuinely care about the character, the lore, the absurdist humor. Leon Karssen's 12-year battle-tested commitment to this silly blue cat is incredible.

**Pre-crypto IP**: Most memecoins are created for speculation. Nubcat is a 13-year-old internet meme that *became* a token. That's backwards from 99% of the market. The character had 250k+ Instagram followers before $NUB existed. That's not hype. That's culture.

**The founder is battle-tested**: Leon Karssen kept creating Nubcat content for over a decade with zero financial incentive. Through platform changes, algorithm shifts, trends coming and going. That's the kind of founder obsession that builds lasting brands.

**Community resilience**: The @nubcat Twitter account has been banned multiple times. The community didn't fold. They rallied with "Free Nubcat" campaigns. Solana's official account supported them. They kept creating. That's cult behavior in the best way.

### What Winning Looks Like for Nubcat

Winning looks like Nubcat creating **massive IP that can monetize in multiple ways**:
- Comics and merchandise
- Media partnerships and crossovers
- Brand collaborations
- Community-created derivative works

And **$NUB represents that IP**. The community works together to create things that are immense. The token becomes the coordination mechanism for collective value creation.

This is the rare memecoin phenomenon that isn't going away. True communities will stay, will find ways to coordinate, and will create enormous value through many avenues.

## What Orggly Actually Is

Orggly (formerly called "Align") is modular infrastructure for token projects on Solana.

**Core thesis**: Token communities need professional tools to coordinate work, pay contributors in their own tokens, and build value beyond speculation.

**What we built**:

1. **Jobs Platform** - Three types of work coordination:
   - Regular Jobs: Traditional freelance gigs (art, content, code) with escrow payment
   - Contest Jobs: Multiple submissions, judged winners, prize pools
   - Social Jobs: Campaign-style social media content at scale (this is the focus for Nubcat)

2. **Social Media Campaigns** - The breakthrough feature:
   - Communities can run paid Twitter/X campaigns
   - Pay holders to create content in project tokens
   - Tiered payment based on follower count + engagement bonuses
   - Escrow-based, trustless payments
   - First-come-first-served until budget depletes

3. **Treasury Management** - Professional tools for buybacks and distributions

4. **IP Verification** - Verify ownership of social accounts and brand

5. **Karma System** - Track contributions, curation voting, reputation

**Tech stack**: Next.js, Solana, Supabase, real-time messaging

**Current status**: Live in beta. Nubcat will be our first major campaign launch.

## The Technical Innovation: Social Jobs

The Social Jobs feature is what makes Orggly different from generic bounty platforms.

**How it works**:
- Project creates a campaign (Retweet or Original Tweet)
- Sets total budget in project token
- Configures follower tiers (0-1K, 1K-5K, 5K-20K, etc) with different payouts
- Optional: Impression bonuses (+$5 per 1K impressions)
- Budget locks in escrow (on-chain)
- Workers submit their tweets
- Auto-approval after review period OR manual approval
- Payments distributed proportionally

**Why this matters**:
- Communities can pay holders in their own tokens (not ETH/SOL)
- Escrow prevents rug pulls
- Follower tiers create fair compensation (micro-influencer gets $10, larger account gets $50)
- Impression bonuses reward quality over just participation
- First-come-first-served creates urgency

**Timeline structure** (auto-calculated):
- Hours 0-48: Submission period
- Hours 48-72: Engagement tracking
- Hours 72-120: Review period
- Hour 120+: Auto-approval + payment

This isn't a bounty board. This is campaign infrastructure.

## Core Beliefs

### On Memecoins
Memecoins are a permanent fixture of crypto, not a phase. The question isn't "will memecoins survive" but "which memecoin communities can build beyond speculation."

Communities with real culture, pre-existing IP, and battle-tested founders will survive. The rest will fade.

### On Community Coordination
Communities need a place to work and grow together. We have thousands of token communities and groups forming, but they lack infrastructure to actually create together.

Twitter is where you spread information. Telegram is where you hype. But communities need somewhere to build the thing worth hyping.

### On Platform Fees
Most platforms extract value and give nothing back to creators. We're inverting that. With Orggly, project fees flow back to the people who built the IP, not to investors who added capital.

For the Nubcat launch, we're sharing 50% of our platform fees directly with Leon Karssen. That's alignment.

## The Elon / "Free Nubcat" Context

The @nubcat Twitter account has been suspended multiple times. It's currently banned.

This matters because:
- Shows platform fragility (accounts can be killed arbitrarily)
- Demonstrates community resilience (they kept creating despite bans)
- Creates natural narrative ("Free Nubcat" rallying cry)
- Proves the cult factor (community didn't fold when official account died)

Including "Free our boy" in the campaign tweet is:
- Genuine solidarity (ban was unjust)
- Memetic signal (shows I understand community culture)
- Strategic (gets attention + shows alignment)

It's all three. Communities can tell when you're just using them vs when you actually care. Even if banned, the cat will live on through the community. But he should be free.

## Communication Principles

### Voice & Tone
- Builder-authentic, not marketer-polished
- Technical when relevant, accessible when not
- Contrarian but not edgy for the sake of it
- Honest about limitations and unknowns
- Excited but not overselling

### What I Don't Do
- Hype product launches with superlatives
- Promise decentralization theater
- Pretend crypto fixes everything
- Talk about "disruption" unironically
- Use VC buzzwords

### What I Do
- Share real progress and blockers
- Admit when things break
- Give credit to communities and builders
- Focus on utility over narrative
- Let the product speak

## The Nubcat Partnership Thesis

Why Nubcat for the first campaign:

1. **Proven community resilience**: Survived Twitter bans, market dumps, founder hiatus. Still here.

2. **Real IP**: 12 years of pre-crypto history. 250k+ Instagram followers. Registered on Story Protocol. This isn't vaporware.

3. **Cult factor**: Holders genuinely care about the character, not just the token price. That's rare.

4. **Leon Karssen**: Battle-tested creator who kept building for 12 years with zero financial incentive. That's founder obsession.

5. **Aligned incentives**: Fee-sharing with Leon means if Orggly wins, he wins. Not extractive, collaborative.

6. **Medium market cap** (~$10.5M): Big enough to have liquidity, small enough to move if execution is good.

7. **Solana native**: Same chain, same ecosystem, same tools.

This isn't random. Nubcat is proof-of-concept for the thesis: *real communities with real IP can use Orggly to coordinate and create value*.

## Key Narratives

### 1. Communities Need Better Tools
"Most token communities die because they have no way to coordinate beyond Telegram hype chats. Orggly gives them infrastructure to actually work together."

### 2. Memecoins as Coordination Mechanisms
"The best memecoins aren't speculation vehicles. They're community coordination tools. $NUB proves this - 12 years of culture before a single token existed."

### 3. Fee-Sharing with Creators
"Platform fees should flow to people who built the IP, not VCs who added capital. That's why we're sharing 50% of fees with Leon Karssen for the Nubcat campaign."

### 4. Cult > Hype
"Communities with cult-like dedication survive. Communities built on hype die. Nubcat holders kept creating when the Twitter account got banned. That's the signal."

### 5. Infrastructure > Narrative
"Crypto doesn't need more narratives. It needs tools that work. Orggly is boring infrastructure that lets communities coordinate. That's the thesis."
