## January 13, 2026 - Initial Setup

**Files:** All (complete repository creation)

**Changes:** 
- Created complete repository structure with 18 files
- Established NOW.md as living source of truth
- Built out strategy/, playbooks/, tracking/, content/ directories
- Documented Nubcat launch campaign approach

**Why:** 
Nubcat campaign launch preparation. Need centralized marketing command center that evolves with learnings rather than static documentation.

**Impact:** 
Marketing operations now have single source of truth. All team members can reference NOW.md for current priorities and playbooks/ for execution tactics.

**Key Decision:** 
Pivoted from "cold launch" approach to "listening tour" approach on Day 1 after zero traction. This is documented in NOW.md and tracking/fails.md.
